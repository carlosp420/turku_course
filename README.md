# Good templates for teaching software development

## Software Carpentry
Unix shell, Git and R (we can replace R for Python)
    <https://github.com/karthik/2014-10-31-nw>.

They are using a Creative Commons license. So we can use the material, remix
it but need to give credits.

## Other courses on Python
There are many here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining>. We can
cherry-pick from there. It seems that a ovewiew course including
test-driven-development (TDD)and other best-practices are not too common? Maybe not
for very beginners maybe.

One option could be to teach the very basics of Python from the
"best-practices" approach. (Pep8 and TDD).
