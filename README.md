# Good templates for teaching software development

## Software Carpentry

Unix shell, Git and R (we can replace R for Python)
    <https://github.com/karthik/2014-10-31-nw>.

They are using a Creative Commons license. So we can use the material, remix it
but need to give credits.

## Other courses on Python

There are many here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining>. We can
cherry-pick from there. It seems that a ovewiew course including
test-driven-development (TDD)and other best-practices are not too common? Maybe
not for very beginners maybe.

One option could be to teach the very basics of Python from the
"best-practices" approach. (Pep8 and TDD).

# Material to define the teaching objectives

The points we want to teach will depend on the expected audience level
(beginner, proficient user, advanced) an also of course on our own skills!

This blog <http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/> gives a good
view of programming skills at different stages of a programmer learning
life. Maybe we can use it as a basis to select what to teach to which audience?

There is also this site
<http://www.wayland-informatics.com/The%20Seven%20Stages%20of%20Expertise%20in%20Software.htm>.

## Important concepts to teach

(see also the Software Carpentry materials)

To complete beginners (i.e. people would never used Python or R):
* introduction to a programming language (Python, R or even just the bash
  shell)
* automation of repeated tasks by writing scripts (again, using Python, R or
the bash)
* version controlling of scripts

To more experienced users:
* tests and test-driven development
* debugging (symbolic debugger)
