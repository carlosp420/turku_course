# Final project (day three)

The end of the third day will be devoted to the students working as several
small groups within a team to distribute tasks, write, test and share code in
order to create a small and complete Python module. The purpose of the module
can be a project proposed by the students themselves (the preferred options) or
chosen by the teachers.
