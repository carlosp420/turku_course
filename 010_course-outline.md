Summary: Short description of the course contents
Sortorder: 010

Here are the outlines of the different course sections:

- Day one
    + [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/mdjbru-teaching-material/turku_course/blob/master/course-material/introduction-to-python/intro_python.md)
      ([Previous draft]({filename}course-outline_010_introduction-to-python.md))
    + [Version control with Git](https://github.com/mdjbru-teaching-material/turku_course/blob/master/course-material/version-control-with-git/intro-git.md)
	  ([Previous draft]({filename}course-outline_020_version-control-with-git.md))

- Day two
    + [Introduction to the shell]({filename}course-outline_030_introduction-shell.md)
    + [Testing, debugging and code profiling]({filename}course-outline_040_testing-debugging-profiling.md)

- Day three
    + Documentation in Python
    + Virtual environments
    + Wrapping up: developing an integrated project

A follow-up session might take place later in the year if enough people are
interested in it.

# Final project (day three)

The end of the third day will be devoted to the students working as several
small groups within a team to distribute tasks, write, test and share code in
order to create a small and complete Python module. The purpose of the module
can be a project proposed by the students themselves (the preferred options) or
chosen by the teachers.

# Teachers for each course section

Durations of each section are very rough estimates. If we are going faster or
slower than expected, some topics may be treated earlier or later, or
altogether skipped if more time is spent on another topic in which people have
more interest.
