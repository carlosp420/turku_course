* Version control

** A common problem

***                                                                 :BMCOL:

** Reproducibility of research?

- Research should be reproducible by others.
- This refers to the experiments generating the data, but also to the analysis
  of the data.
- The first researcher who will need to reproduce your results is likely to be
  **you**.

** A lab notebook for analyses ?

- Lab books make lab work traceable. Analyses should also be traceable.
- Analysis steps must be recorded, and reverting to any previous step must be
  possible.
- This ensures that we always exactly know how a result was generated.

** Version control

- Version control is a tool to keep track of file changes.
- However, version control softwares offer more than simply recording
  successive versions of a file.
- Version controlled projects can be forked, merged and shared with
  collaborators.
- Interesting both for collaborative work and for single developper (the single
  developper case will be developped in more details later)

** Example of a version control workflow

![Version control workflow](img/version-control-workflow.gif)

- **V1**, **V2**, and **V3** are successive versions of the script
- **V4** is committed, but then a mistake is found. We revert to **V3**
- A new, correct **V4** is committed
- **V5** and **V6** are successive versions of the script
- At this point, we want to implement a new feature that might be interesting,
  but which is experimental. In order to keep **V6** clean, we create a new
  branch in which we can experiment with the script without damaging the stable
  **V6**
- **V6b** and **V7b** are successive versions of the experimental script
- At some point, the experimental changes are mature and we want to merge them
  back into the master branch. **V7b** and **V6** are merged together into **V8**
- We realise we want to revert to a previous version of one function in the
  script. For this function, we revert to the code present in **V2**, keep all
  the rest as it is in **V8** and commit it as **V9**
- **V10** is the next commit

### What are the available tools?

- Existing version control tools:
  + [**Subversion**](https://subversion.apache.org/),
  + [**Bazaar**](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/),
  + [**Mercurial**](http://mercurial.selenic.com/),
  + [**Git**](http://git-scm.com/)
- Online servers for repositories:
  + [**BitBucket**](https://bitbucket.org/) (free private repositories)
  + [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) (free for public repositories but not for
    private repositories)

## Installing and setting up Git

## Setting up and using remote repositories

### Creating a new remote repository

- Set up a GitHub account
- Create a new repository

### Pushing to the remote repository

- Push to the new repository

## Cloning an existing project

- Clone a project prepared by the teachers
- Modify the code and send a pull request
- Clone a real life example (e.g. python GO parser)
