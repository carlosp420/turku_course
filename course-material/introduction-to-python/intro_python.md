## Let's choose Python for this workshop:

* Python is language with a precise, simple and efficient syntax.
* Thus, it is easy to write, read and understand code.
* Python has libraries for statistic analysisa and plotting of data,
  comparable to those in R:  **NumPy, matplotlib and SciPy**.
* There are popular toolkits for bioinformatics such as BioPython.

## Installation of Python
* Python2 versus Python3. To install, or not to install, that is the question. 
  Let's install Python 3.4.3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/>
  
* Install IPython:

```shell
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ipython
```

## Basics of Python
* We will do some exercises before writing *real code*. Fire up IPython from 
your command line:

```shell
ipython
```

```ipython
