The aim of this course is to teach **good practices in informatics** to
scientists whose primary field is not computer science.

Scientists increasingly need to rely on computer tools to perform their
research. However, they often lack formal education on how to design and use
computer software efficiently and reliably. Every step is an analysis pipeline
should be easily reproducible, but this is often not the case.

We aim at teaching researchers a few basic concepts and tools which will help
them to improve their use of computer resources by

- **Automating** repetitive tasks
- **Documenting**, **testing** and **keeping track** of program code
- Making it easier to **reuse** and **share** their code.

The course does not aim at teaching everything in a few days, but at exposing
the researchers to some key ideas and making them well-equipped to learn by
themselves what they will still miss at the end of the course.

# Who is teaching this course?

We are researchers in biology who learnt about informatics on the way, as
programming skills were becoming necessary for our research projects.

# Who can attend this course?

There is no need for prior experience with programming to attend the course.

# Where and when is it taking place?

The course will take place in the Genetics seminar room (Pharmacity, Turku)
from the xxth of January to the xxth of February 2015.
