# Important practical details

A large portion of the course (most of it actually) will be hands-on work, and
students are expected to bring a laptop with a wireless internet connection to
be able to practice as they learn. *Sparknet* is available in the Genetics
seminar room (but the students should have their own *Sparknet*
credentials). Please contact us beforehand if you don't have access to a laptop
for the course or if you don't have a *Sparknet* account.

The material taught is valid for Windows, Linux and MacOS systems. The students
are expected to have installed the necessary software on their machine before
they attend the course. System-specific instructions are usually found on the
installation pages of the software:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Ipython](http://ipython.org/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/doc)
- a text editor with syntax highlighting such as
  [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows or
  [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) for Linux (TODO: add a free software text
  editor for Mac?)
- [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) for
  remote connection to an ssh server using Windows
- [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or
  [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for file transfer to a remote
  server

TODO: Check with CSC how it works to get students accounts
