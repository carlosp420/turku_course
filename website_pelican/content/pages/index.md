The aim of this course is to teach **good practices in informatics** to
scientists whose primary field is not computer science.

Scientists increasingly need to rely on computer tools to perform their
research. However, they often lack a formal education on how to design and use
computer software efficiently and reliably. Every step is an analysis pipeline
should be easily reproducible, but this is often not the case.

We aimed at teaching researchers a few basic concepts and tools which will help
them to improve their use of computer resources by

- **automating** repetitive tasks
- **documenting**, **testing** and **keeping track** of program code
- making it easier to **reuse** and **share** their code.

The course does not aim at teaching everything in a few days, but at exposing
the researchers to some key ideas and making them well-equipped to learn by
themselves what they will still miss at the end of the course.

# Who is teaching this course?

We are researchers in biology who learnt about informatics on the way, as
programming skills were becoming necessary for our research projects. For now
the planned teachers are [Carlos Pe√±a](http://nymphalidae.utu.fi/cpena/) and
[Matthieu Bruneaux](http://mdjbru.toile-libre.org/).

# Who can attend this course?

There is no need for prior experience with programming to attend the
course. The course is open to everybody, students and researchers. There is no
registration fee, but we expect people who enroll to attend or to warn us in
advance if they can't.

# How much credits can I get from the course?

The plan is to provide 2 credits to students attending the three days and
fulfilling the homework tasks.

# Where and when is it taking place?

The course will take place in the Genetics seminar room (Pharmacity, Turku) in
April 2015. Two formula are possible for now and the choice between the two
will be made soon:

- three days in a row (convenient if people from outside Turku would like to join)
- one day per week during three weeks (makes it easier for people to try what
  they learnt from one week to the next and come up with questions the next
  week)
