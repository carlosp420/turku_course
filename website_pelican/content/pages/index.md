# What is this course about?

The aim of this course is to teach good practices in informatics to scientists
whose primary field is not copmuter science.

# Who is teaching this course?

We are researchers in biology who learnt about informatics on the way, as
programming skills were becoming necessary for our research projects.

# Who can attend this course?

There is no need for prior experience with programming to attend the course.

# Where and when does it take place?

For now, we plan to have it at the end of January 2015 in the Genetics seminar
room.
