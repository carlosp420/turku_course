    <p>The aim of this course is to teach <strong>good practices in informatics</strong> to
scientists whose primary field is not computer science.</p>
<p>Scientists increasingly need to rely on computer tools to perform their
research. However, they often lack a formal education on how to design and use
computer software efficiently and reliably. Every step is an analysis pipeline
should be easily reproducible, but this is often not the case.</p>
<p>We aimed at teaching researchers a few basic concepts and tools which will help
them to improve their use of computer resources by</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>automating</strong> repetitive tasks</li>
<li><strong>documenting</strong>, <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>keeping track</strong> of program code</li>
<li>making it easier to <strong>reuse</strong> and <strong>share</strong> their code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course does not aim at teaching everything in a few days, but at exposing
the researchers to some key ideas and making them well-equipped to learn by
themselves what they will still miss at the end of the course.</p>
<h1>Who is teaching this course?</h1>
<p>We are researchers in biology who learnt about informatics on the way, as
programming skills were becoming necessary for our research projects.</p>
<h1>Who can attend this course?</h1>
<p>There is no need for prior experience with programming to attend the course.</p>
<h1>Where and when is it taking place?</h1>
<p>The course will take place in the Genetics seminar room (Pharmacity, Turku)
from the xxth of January to the xxth of February 2015.</p>
